# Cypress-basico-v2

Sample project for the basic course of the Talking About Testing Online School.

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions `v16.15.0` and `8.5.5` of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

You can run the tests simulating a desktop or mobile viewport.

### Desktop

Run `npm cy:run` to run the test in headless mode.

Or, run `npm cy:open` to open Cypress in interactive mode.

### Desktop

Run `npm cy:run:mobile` to run the test in headless viewport mode.

Or, run `npm cy:open:mobile` to open Cypress in interactive viewport mode.
